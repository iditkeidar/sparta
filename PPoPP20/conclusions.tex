\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We presented \alg, a practical algorithm for approximate top-k retrieval on multi-core hardware. 
\alg\ can support modern analytics and search experiences, which induce long queries, within real-time  requirements. 
To our knowledge, \alg\ is the first algorithm capable of serving  long queries ($10$ or more terms)
on server-grade hardware
within interactive latency bounds.



\alg\ leverages the efficiency and early-stopping properties of the seminal Threshold Algorithm. 
It forgoes the need for random access and duplicate indexes by relying on  TA's 
NRA variant. 
It achieves high performance by 
optimizing memory footprints, memory access patterns, inter-thread data sharing, and synchronization.  

\alg\/ scales perfectly with dataset size. In a web search use case, \alg\ yields average latencies of  $180$ ms on standard hardware for queries of up to $12$ terms,  
when applied to datasets of both $50$M and $500$M documents. 
It does so while producing a highly accurate approximation of the exact results (a recall of above $97.5\%$). 
For comparison, its state-of-the-art parallel competitors, \pBMW\/ and \pJASS,  
require $640$ ms and above 1 second, respectively, to provide similar accuracy on the 50M document dataset;
on the larger dataset,  \pBMW's latency soars to almost 10 seconds, while \pJASS\ crashes.
