\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We presented \alg, a practical algorithm for approximate top-k retrieval on server-grade multi-core hardware. 
To our knowledge, \alg\ is the first algorithm capable of serving  long queries ($10$ or more terms)
within interactive latency bounds.
\alg\ can therefore support modern search experiences -- which induce long queries -- within real-time SLA requirements. 


\alg\ leverages the efficiency and early-stopping properties of the seminal Threshold Algorithm. 
It forgoes the need for random access and duplicate indices by using the  TA's 
NRA variant. 
It achieves high performance by 
optimizing memory footprints, memory access patterns, inter-thread data sharing, and synchronization.  

\alg\/ yields sub-$180$ ms average latencies on standard hardware for queries of up to $12$ terms when applied 
to large data sets of $50$M and $500$M documents. 
  It does so while producing a highly accurate approximation of the exact results 
(a recall of above $97.5\%$).

For comparison, its state-of-the-art parallel competitors, \pBMW\/ and \pJASS,  
required $640$ ms and above 1 second, respectively, to provide similar accuracy.
